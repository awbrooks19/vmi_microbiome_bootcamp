**An introduction to microbiota community analysis**

   - Organized by the `Vanderbilt Microbiome Initiative (VMI) <https://my.vanderbilt.edu/microbiome/>`_ and funded by `Vanderbilt University Trans-Institutional Programs (TIPs) <https://www.vanderbilt.edu/strategicplan/trans-institutional-programs/tipshome.php>`_
   - Founded By - Members of the Dept. Biological Sciences, Peabody college, School of Engineering, and the Medical Center
   - Research – 120 Vanderbilt scholars committed to fundamental and translational microbiome research
   - Multidisciplinary Community - Biological Sciences, Biostatistics, Cell and Developmental Biology, Chemistry, Medicine, Epidemiology, PMI, GHN, Vantage
   - Education and Training – Campus-wide programs to deploy state-of-the-art tools to propel microbiome research
   - Ongoing Clinical Trial - Multi'omic, dietary intervention, temporal sampling, multi-ethnic

**Goals:**

   1. Understand the importance of good experimental design 

   2. Explore the critical steps in a typical microbiome amplicon sequencing analysis

   3. Utilize the QIIME2 pipeline to process microbiome datasets
