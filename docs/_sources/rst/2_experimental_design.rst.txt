Experimental Design and Sample Preparation
============================================

**Key Takeaways**

**There are caveats and biases in every method**
   - Understand the biases in your methods
   - Understand how that bias will affect results

**Plan and optimize well, then stick to one protocol!**

Experimental Design
------------------------------------------------------------------

**How do I start a microbiome amplicon study? Plan ahead!**

It is particularly important to consider the details of your study before you start
   
   - Cannot add samples later
   - Cannot remove contamination after samples are collected
   - Cannot add controls necessary to validate quality after sequencing
   - Cannot remove bias if other factors very with treatment of interest
   - Cannot get more microbial DNA if host DNA dominates

**Start with a question and hypothesis.**
   - Consider expected effect size on microbiome composition
   - Calculate how many samples will be needed to detect if the effect exists
   - Consider changes community wide and detecting changes in taxon abundance and presence
   - Keep in mind not every sample will pass every QC step - samples will be lost
      - Larger N
      - Parallel processing replicates
     
**Always step back and ask: "Will a whole community profile answer my question?"**
   - Often people hypothesize that "the microbiome will change", without considering what that actually means
     - Amplicon sequencing doesn't tell you community function
     - It won't give you strain or even consistent species level resoultion
        - In addition to *E. coli*, there are five other species in the genus *Escheria* and some are commensal in the human gut

Sampling and Controls
------------------------------------------------------------------

**How will you collect your samples?**

**Generally consider in collection:**
   
   - **Size of sample** 
      - Determines available DNA
      - Can you control an equal amount from each subject - *absolute quantification*
      - Reserve sample - mix evenly so reserve is the same as utilized sample
   
   - **Sampling vessel**
      - Ease of collection
      - Sterility
      - Stabilization solution
         - Need DNA *and* RNA
         - Other 'omics - *i.e. mass spectrometry affected by salt concentration*

   - **Storage**
      - Immediate storage -80C
      - Long term stabilization solutions can introduce bias
      - Prevent bacterial overgrowth at room temperature
     
**Key controls to keep in mind:**
   
   - **Uniformity**
      
      - Collect samples at the same time and method across treatment groups
     
      - Same for processing DNA extraction and library preparation for sequencing
     
   - **Randomization**
      
      - Consider many factors that could vary across treatment groups
         - Time of day, season
         - Sampling in same location
     
      - Mouse cage effects
         - Co-housing
         - Mixing bedding and food
     
   - **Sterility**
     
      - Collect samples, but also sample microbes in the local environment if possible
      
      - Always include blank water samples
         - Collection blank
         - Extraction blank
         - Library preparation blank
       - Sequencing blank

      - Work in biosaftey hood whenever possible
         - Particularly sensitive to contamination before PCR steps

   - **Mock community**
      - Known taxonomy and abundance
     
   - **Generous donor**
      - If sampling / extracting / sequencing in batches include one consistent sample across each

**If working with human subjects:**

   - Consider ease of self-collection
   - Different body sites have very different communities
      - Even location on a stool sample (inside versus outside)
   - Biopsies are loaded with human DNA
   - IRB compliant methods 
      - Gloves
      - Way to catch stool in toilet and disposal
      - Proper instructions
   - Immediate acquisition versus returning samples later 
      - Cannot control amount provided if self-collection
	  - Must stablize to prevent bacterial overgrowth, or 'blooms'

DNA Extraction
------------------------------------------------------------------

**DNA extraction techniques vary significantly in community bias**

   - Every kit introduces bias, so pick one and stick with it!
      - There are many options, so research which is best for your long term goals
      - The `Earth Microbiome Project  <http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/protocols-and-standards/dna-extraction-protocol/>`_ has well documented protocols.
     
   - Efficiency at lysing cells is important
      - Bead beating versus chemical lysis
      - Mechanical bead beating seems to be most thorough gram +/-
      - Keep in mind bead beating heats the sample through friction, don't over-do it!
     
   - Take time to properly optimize and document
      - Always note extraction batch, who performed the extraction, and the kit lot number
      - Always include extraction blanks, all kits have contaminants - `kit'ome <https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-014-0087-z>`_.
      - Some kits perform dual DNA and RNA extraction

Amplification
------------------------------------------------------------------

**PCR amplification of the marker gene of interest**

   - **Use known protocols and established primers**
      - Different variable regions bias the community differently, stick to what's known!
      - The `Earth Microbiome Project  <http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/protocols-and-standards/16s/>`_ has well documented PCR protocols (*16S, 18S, ITS*)
      - Always optimize your PCR for the expected sequence length and concentration
      - Include PCR blank to control for processing contamination
     
   - **Sequencing Depth**
      - Generally 10k - 100k sequences per sample is adequate coverage
     - Diminishing returns at greater depths
        - Taxonomic resolution based on sequence length not sequencing depth
       - Many reads increase sequencing errors, qc filtered
       - Analyses are rarefied or relative abundance
          - Rare organisms will still be rare, depth doesn't change proportions

   - Each sample PCR reaction will be performed with it's own unique barcode combination
   - This allows bioinformatic demultiplexing - assigning sequences to their respective sample

Sequencing Platforms
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Illumina**

   - By far the most widely used sequencing method
      - Millions of sequences allow multiplexing many samples on one run
      - High coverage of the community (~10k sequences per sample is ideal depending on complexity)
   
   - Short sequences 100-250bp generally cover 1-3 variable regions
      - Allows high coverage, but lose resolution past genus level
      - Paired end is better than single end

**Illumina Amplicon Sequencing at VANTAGE**
   - 250 bp sequence reads (Covers entire V4 region)
   - Dual-index sequencing strategy - increased multiplexing
   - Each MiSeq run produces >5,000,000 reads (Great for multiplexing)
   - Best option for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing
   - VANTAGE also offers HiSeq, NextSeq, and NovaSeq Illumina sequencing platforms
      - MiSeq has 250bp length, other platforms only offer shorter reads so plan ahead

**PacBio and Nanopore**
   
   - Could do full 16S gene
      - Very high strain level resolution
      - But *much* lower coverage and multiplexing = higher costs
      - Higher error rates

Mapping File
------------------------------------------------------------------

**How do you store all of this information about samples in a useful way?**

   - **A mapping file is composed of:**
      - Each row representing a sample
      - Each column representing some information about each sample
      - Are TSV - tab separated values
         - TSV is a .txt output format from Excel
      - A header line starting with a # indicates the column names

.. figure:: ../images/map_exp.png
   :scale: 30 %
   :alt: map_exp
   
   Source: Example mapping file in excel.

      - Always start with **#sampleid** column 
         - A unique id for each sample - cannot be the same as any other sample
     
      - Include columns for the unique sample **barcodes** 
         - Allows demultiplexing of sequences to their respective sample
     
      - Also include **control and qc** information about DNA extraction batch, person extracting, PCR batch, sequencing run, cage...
         - Allows testing if these factors influenced the community composition
         - Have columns indicating which samples are blanks, mock community, and generous donor samples
       
      - Have columns for your **treatement** and any **covariates** of interest
         - Age, sex, BMI, collection season...
       
      - Last column should be **description** if you need backward compatibility with QIIME1

**Best Practices**

   - Rule Number 1: Don't get fancy!
      - Don't use spaces, use _ (underscore) instead
      - Except #sampleid, the only punctuation in this column can be dashes '-' (no underscores)
      - Don't include other types of punctuation, this will only cause problems later on!
     
   - Leading and trailing white spaces are ignored
   
   - I'd stick to all lower-case (case insensitive) characters
      - Not required, but may save you a *lot* of trouble with weird errors later on!
