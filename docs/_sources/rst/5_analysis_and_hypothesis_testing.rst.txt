Microbiome Analysis and Hypothesis Testing
============================================

**How do we ask the questions we are actually interested in?**
   - Observations of the community are great, but don't address a hypothesis
   - We can both visually and statistically draw conclusions about microbiome composition
   

Ordination and Composition Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------

**First an example...**

They looked at how patients responded to treatment, and how that related to survival...

They also looked at the gut microbiome as an ordination...

**What does this ordination show?**

   - Each dot represents an individual sample... a measure of their total gut community
      - They colored each dot based on whether they responded to treatment or not
      
   - How close two dots are shows how similar their microbial communities are
      - Closer = more similar
      - Farther = less similar
      
   - The controids show where the middle, or average, is for responders and non-responders
      - While some individuals from each group overlap, there is clear divergence in the average for each group
      
   - Axis 1 and 2
      - These are *components of variation* measuring differences across all the microbiomes
      - The *percent variance explained* shows how much difference in microbiomes is captured along that vector
      - These are somewhat arbitrary and are a result of the variation in the data
         - Specific to the samples and features going into the analysis
         - Tip: Do not compare between ordinations, only within an ordination!
         
   
**Ok... but what is an ordination?**
   - A way of collapsing variation in complex data along vectors
      - Hundreds of samples and thousands of microbes can be drawn into two dimensions
      
   - Each dimension captures a percentage of the total variation in the data
      - 50% of variance like above means there is a lot of difference being captured
      - In noisy data (Human Microbiome Project) 5-20% is a lot of variation to be captured by one dimension
      
   - A really useful approach to quickly see patterns in data, however...
      - Treat these as qualitative exploratory analyses, and not quantitative of effect size
      - Information is lost when data is collapsed from N to two dimensions
      - Underlying math can be biased depending on data distributions
         - Don't give quantitative stock to things like centroid distance

**Here is my favorite example using human genetic data:**

**Here is a great example of one way things can go wrong...**
   - Let's say there are 20 taxon in an ordination
   - Linearly related with taxon 1 most distant from taxon 20
   - Clearly we don't see that below
      - Has to do with a unimodal effect distortion in eigenvector space... go find a statistician to translate

Diversity Analysis in More Detail
-----------------------------------------------

**Before we assessed alpha diversity between categorical groups**
   - What if your variable of interest is continuous?

.. code-block:: bash

   # for each alpha diversity metric...
   for alpha_metric in faith_pd shannon observed_otus evenness
   do
      
      # Calculate alpha diversity correlation
      qiime diversity alpha-correlation \
         --i-alpha-diversity "$diversity_folder""$alpha_metric"_vector.qza \
         --m-metadata-file "$map" \
         --o-visualization american_gut/2_5_alpha_correlation_"$alpha_metric".qzv
   
   #Remember to close the for loop
   done

**And then we can view the results...**

.. code-block:: bash
   
   alpha_metric=shannon
   #alpha_metric=faith_pd
   #alpha_metric=observed_otus
   #alpha_metric=evenness
   
   qiime tools view american_gut/2_5_alpha_correlation_"$alpha_metric".qzv

**Uses non-parametric Spearman correlation, which works off ranks like Kruskal Wallis**
   - Microbiome data is not normal, predictable, and thus will cause problems with many statistical tests
   - QIIME2 uses the proper tests to account for this
   - If you are trying to implement your own test make sure you know that limitations and caveats


**Let's look at beta diversity across groups**
   - There are lots of options: qiime diversity beta-group-significance --help
   - Permanova & Anosim tests
      - Permanova - mathematically more like a regression
      - Anosim - more like an anova
      - If your variable is categorical I'd do both
       
.. code-block:: bash
   
   # Calculate correlation of variable with beta diversity
   qiime diversity beta-group-significance \
      --i-distance-matrix "$diversity_folder"bray_curtis_distance_matrix.qza \
      --m-metadata-file "$map" \
      --m-metadata-column bmi_cat \
      --p-pairwise \
      --o-visualization american_gut/2_6_beta_significance_bmi_cat_bray_curtis.qzv
   
   # View results
   qiime tools view american_gut/2_6_beta_significance_bmi_cat_bray_curtis.qzv

**How would you change this function to be more adaptable in a pipeline?**
   - Multiple metadata columns
   - Multiple beta diversity metrics

Community and Taxonomic Differential Abundance Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------

**What if we are interested in features or taxa that are shifting in abundance?**


First let's examine abundances across samples with a heatmap
   - But Feature numbers like 48437593 are not very informative
   - Let's collapse our table by bacterial taxonomy first

.. code-block:: bash
   
   # Collapse at taxonomic level
   qiime taxa collapse \
      --i-table "$table" \
      --i-taxonomy "$tax" \
      --p-level 5 \
      --o-collapsed-table american_gut/2_7_taxonomy_collapsed_l5.qza
   
   # Make a heatmap
   qiime feature-table heatmap \
      --i-table american_gut/2_7_taxonomy_collapsed_l5.qza \
      --o-visualization american_gut/2_8_taxonomy_l5_heatmap.qzv
   
   # View the heatmap
   qiime tools view american_gut/2_8_taxonomy_l5_heatmap.qzv

**Always remember to check the docs**
   - qiime feature-table heatmap --help
   - Options to normalize or not (default = True)
   - Options for the metric to calculate sample distance (default = Euclidian = bad)
   - Options for the method to use when clustering (default = average)
   - *I wouldn't use the default metric and clustering method*

.. figure:: ../images/heatmap.png
   :scale: 90 %
   :alt: heatmap 
   
   Heatmap at the family level.

**Finally let's statistically assess which of these are varying across groups**

.. code-block:: bash
   
   qiime composition add-pseudocount \
      --i-table american_gut/2_7_taxonomy_collapsed_l5.qza \
      --o-composition-table american_gut/2_7_taxonomy_collapsed_l5_composition.qza
   
   qiime composition ancom \
      --i-table american_gut/2_7_taxonomy_collapsed_l5_composition.qza \
      --m-metadata-file "$map" \
      --m-metadata-column age_cat \
      --o-visualization american_gut/2_9_ancom_l5_age_cat.qzv

   qiime tools view american_gut/2_9_ancom_l5_age_cat.qzv

**Oh No! Nothing significantly varies.** 
   - Feel free to try other variables
   - Ancom is very conservative
   - Keep in mind this may happen to you!

   - https://forum.qiime2.org/t/specify-w-cutoff-for-anacom/1844/10?u=mortonjt
   - Remember to use the literature and understand what you are testing!


Random Forest
------------------------------------------------------------------

   Supervised learning classifiers perform series of steps to predict metadata groups from microbiome profiles. Source: https://docs.qiime2.org/2018.8/tutorials/sample-classifier/

.. code-block:: bash

   qiime sample-classifier classify-samples \
      --i-table "$table" \
      --m-metadata-file "$map" \
      --m-metadata-column bmi_cat \
      --p-optimize-feature-selection \
      --p-parameter-tuning \
      --p-estimator RandomForestClassifier \
      --p-n-estimators 20 \
      --output-dir american_gut/3_0_random_forest_bmi_cat
      
   qiime tools view american_gut/3_0_random_forest_bmi_cat/visualization.qzv
   
**Note the caveats, and that you should do a lot more background before throwing advanced statistics around!**
   - QIIME2 is great for simple straight forward analyses, but to go deeper you need to do the legwork
   - Don't get caught presenting results you cannot explain thoroughly!
   
**There are so many other options for analyses, investigate but always use caution**
   - The microbiome field as we know it is ~10 years old
   - Wild-west of statistics and assumptions, best practices are only starting to be enforced
