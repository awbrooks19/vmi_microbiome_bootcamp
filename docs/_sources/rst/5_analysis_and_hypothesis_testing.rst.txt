Microbiome Analysis and Hypothesis Testing
============================================

**How do we ask the questions we are actually interested in?**
   - Observations of the community are great, but don't address a hypothesis
   - We can both visually and statistically draw conclusions about microbiome composition
   

Ordination and Composition Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------

**First an example...**

They looked at how patients responded to treatment, and how that related to survival...

They also looked at the gut microbiome as an ordination...

**What does this ordination show?**

   - Each dot represents an individual sample... a measure of their total gut community
      - They colored each dot based on whether they responded to treatment or not
      
   - How close two dots are shows how similar their microbial communities are
      - Closer = more similar
      - Farther = less similar
      
   - The controids show where the middle, or average, is for responders and non-responders
      - While some individuals from each group overlap, there is clear divergence in the average for each group
      
   - Axis 1 and 2
      - These are *components of variation* measuring differences across all the microbiomes
      - The *percent variance explained* shows how much difference in microbiomes is captured along that vector
      - These are somewhat arbitrary and are a result of the variation in the data
         - Specific to the samples and features going into the analysis
         - Tip: Do not compare between ordinations, only within an ordination!
		 
   
**Ok... but what is an ordination?**
   - A way of collapsing variation in complex data along vectors
      - Hundreds of samples and thousands of microbes can be drawn into two dimensions
	  
   - Each dimension captures a percentage of the total variation in the data
      - 50% of variance like above means there is a lot of difference being captured
	  - In noisy data (Human Microbiome Project) 5-20% is a lot of variation to be captured by one dimension
	  
   - A really useful approach to quickly see patterns in data, however...
      - Treat these as qualitative exploratory analyses, and not quantitative of effect size
      - Information is lost when data is collapsed from N to two dimensions
	  - Underlying math can be biased depending on data distributions
	     - Don't give quantitative stock to things like centroid distance

**Here is my favorite example using human genetic data:**

**Here is a great example of one way things can go wrong...**
   - Let's say there are 20 taxon in an ordination
   - Linearly related with taxon 1 most distant from taxon 20
   - Clearly we don't see that below
      - Has to do with a unimodal effect distortion in eigenvector space... go find a statistician to translate
